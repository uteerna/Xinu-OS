Q1. What are 2 things that you learned from this assignment?
1.	I learnt how to parse the command line arguments in C.
2.	I learnt the usage of volatile keyword 


Q2. What are 2 mistakes that you made in this assignment, and how did you discover and fix these mistakes?
1.	I started working on all modules together which resulted in a lot of confusion and errors. I fixed it by focusing on one module at a time and resolving the errors one by one.
2.	My argument parsing was not working properly as some unknown characters was getting appended after strncpy which resulted in an error, I modified that part by replacing the conditions in the for loop which gave me a proper output.


Q3. If you were restarting this assignment, what would you change about how you went about completing this assignment?
If I am restarting this assignment, then I would try implementing synchronization using message passing. I would also work on one module at a time which can help me in reducting the chances of getting an error and working on one module at a time makes it easier to debug the code.
